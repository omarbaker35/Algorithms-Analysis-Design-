This chapter introduces probabilistic analysis, indicator random variables, and randomized algorithms. It discusses expected running time, randomized QuickSort, and how randomness improves performance and avoids worst-case behavior.This chapter introduces probabilistic analysis, indicator random variables, and randomized algorithms.
